       <p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio portal page!</p>
       
       <p>My name is Adelina Ceja and I am a born and raised Washingtonian. I grew up with an older brother and we both were raised with a keyboard in our hands. I love technology and I'm very passionate about learning how computers process information</p>
       
       <p>I also was around a very sick father who required a lot of intensive care and treatment for sickness. I've been in health care and find it incredibly rewarding to help those who need it. I worked as a phlebotomist in downtown Seattle for a number years. Eventually, I would like to merge my two passions of computers and healthcare and work in a career that can support both of these options. I've gained some skills working as a phlebotomist such as lab work, central processing communications, and helping with customer services.</p>
       
       <p>I am currently a Year Up student, in the software and development track. I'm going to internship in a few months and I'm very excited for the opportunity.</p>
           
       <p>My goals for this program are to gain a deeper understanding of how to write Javascript and Java. I think they're very fun to learn and study. I hope that after my internship is completing that I'll go back to school and continue a bachelor's degree.</p>
